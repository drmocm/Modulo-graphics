# Modulo-graphics
some fun with python

This is just a little test on how to use the TK toolkit on python
and having a little mathematic fun at the same time.

We take a number (n) of equidistant point on a circle and number them 0 to n.
Then we go around the circle and multiply the number of the point x with a
number f, take the result modulo n and connect the point x with the point
y = x*f mod n
After we complete a circle we increase f. This result in a fun little sequence
of patterns.
